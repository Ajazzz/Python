# Python
Numpy | Pandas | Matplotlib | seaborn 


This project is an analysis of the different libraries, in which I use different methods and fuctions of different libraries.

Installation To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

These libraries can be installed using ```pip```, the Python package installer. Open a command prompt and run the following command:
```ruby
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
Alternatively, you can install the Anaconda distribution, which includes these libraries and many others commonly used in data science.

## Usage
To run this project, download the repository and open the Jupyter notebook main.ipynb. This notebook contains the Python code and comments explaining the data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis steps. You can run each code cell by pressing Shift + Enter.

Data
The dataset used in this project is Data ( Different Datasets), which contains information about different variables. And you can also play with different in-build datasets available in scikit-learn library, but in this project, we will load it from a CSV file.

Results
Our analysis cover all the basics to advanced EDA and data cleansing methods using different python functions.
